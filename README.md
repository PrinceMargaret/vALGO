### vALGO
<p>vALGO helps students to visualize various traversal and operations performed on data structure through amazing animations.<br>
vALGO also has ðŸ”Š audio explanation feature which helps to understand traversals and operations performed in a better format.
</p>
<p>I have converted this GUI into executable file and it will work on windows even if you dont have python installed.</p>
